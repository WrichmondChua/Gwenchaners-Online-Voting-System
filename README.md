# Gwenchaners-Online-Voting-System
This includes the source codes needed in making the online voting system.
And we featured this in our school's competition called, Code Hackathon, which happened during our IT Week from April 18,2022-April 21, 2022. 
We won the 1st runner up in that event
I worked on this system with James, Ian, Arville, and Rodrigo and our team name was Gwenchaners.
These people that I mentioned are very awesome.
